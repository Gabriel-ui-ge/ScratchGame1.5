    <h2>Our Goal</h2>
    <pre>
      Goal:  
      By 2030, help poor and vulnerable people survive disasters like floods, storms, droughts, economic crashes, 
      and social problems without their lives falling apart.
      
      Basically:
      Make sure the people who already have the least don’t get hit the hardest when bad stuff happens.
